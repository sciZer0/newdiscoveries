## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might [see](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a), all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ### The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

But there is another fundamental errors:

* the official concept of Work -- being wrong
* the official concept of Energy -- being wrong
* the official concept of Force being -- wrong
* the official Law of conservation of Energy -- being wrong

All these fundamental errors together result in the endless series of errors in science.

## 2.1. Work and Energy in the Most General Sense

In modern science the whole logic about Work and Energy is absolutely wrong, so we need to start from the very beginning, from defining Work and Energy in the Most General Sense.

So.

Even official science considers that the Universe in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

Importantly, I absolutely agree with this above.

Let’s call anyone (anything) that can do Work “Organism”.

Of course, we might use the "System" word instead of the "Organism" word but the reason of the choice will be clear a bit below.

So, 

> ### Organism is anyone (anything) that can be doing Work.

In my opinion, in the most general sense,

> ### Work is any activity of Organism that is spending Energy (some resource).

Or in other words,

Work is any activity of Organism that requires Energy (some resource)

On the other hand, 


> ### Energy is the resource for Organism to be doing Work.

And of course, 

> ### Work and Energy have the same unit of measure.

## 2.2. Concept of Organism and its Hand

Let's consider the 3 cases simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

In Case #1, a human is holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, the 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, the 20 kg object is sitting motionless on the table during 30 seconds.<br>

What is happening in reality is the following:

In Case #1, a human is pushing upwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, the Universe is pushing downwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, the Universe is pushing downwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>

Let's call anyone (anything) that can be pushing an object during some time “Organism” too.

In Case #1, Organism is a human (say, you).

In Case #2 and Case #3, Organism is the Universe/Nature.

Importantly, in each of the 3 cases,

> ### Organism is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.

More importantly, in each of the 3 cases, 

> ### Organism, by its "Hand", is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.

In Case #1, Hand is the human's hand (say, your hand).

In Case #2 and Case #3, Hand is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand). 

Let's call the thing by which Organism is pushing an object "Hand".

> ### Hand is the thing by which Organism is pushing an object.

So,

In Case #1, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>

--

## 2.3. New Concept of Work and New Concept of Energy

Let's again consider the 3 cases simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

In more detail,

In Case #1, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, with the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.<br>
In Case #2, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, with the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.<br>
In Case #3, Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, with the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.<br>

*More details on how to calculate Force (effort) in each of the 3 cases a bit below.*

Extremely importantly, in each of the 3 cases, 

Organism, by its Hand, is pushing the 20 kg object during every moment of 30 seconds, with the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.

With the same non-zero Force (effort) equal to 196 Newtons.

In other words,

In each of the 3 cases, during every moment, Organism is putting the same effort into the pushing.

One more time,

**In each of the 3 cases, during every moment, Organism is putting the same effort into the pushing.**

Then, 

**Since in each of the 3 cases, during every moment Organism is putting the same effort into the pushing and we exactly know that in Case #2 Organism, doing the pushing, is spending its Energy (resource) on this Work, then it means that in Case 1# and Case #3, Organism, doing the pushing, is also spending its Energy (resource) on this Work.**

Moreover,

**Since in each of the 3 cases, during every moment Organism is putting the same effort into the pushing and we exactly know that in Case #2 Organism, doing the pushing, is doing Mechanical Work and is spending its Energy (resource) on this Work, then it means that in Case 1# and Case #3, Organism, doing the pushing, is also doing Mechanical Work (Static Mechanical Work) and is also spending its Energy (resource) on this Work.**

Bingo! Static Mechanical Work exists.

Please if you did not understand this "bold" thing above, read it again.

The New Concept of Work (Mechanical Work) is:

> ### Work (Mechanical Work) is the process where Organism, by its Hand applying a certain non-zero Force (effort), is pushing an object during every moment of a certain time period.

In other words,

Work is when Organism is putting a certain NON-ZERO Force (effort) into the pushing.

On the other hand, as we already know:

Energy is the resource for Organism to be doing Work.

The New Concept of Energy is:

> ### Energy is the resource for Organism to be pushing an object during every moment of a certain time period.

In other words,

> ### Mechanical Work (Work) is the process of pushing an object, with a certain Force (effort), during every moment of a certain time period.

> ###  Energy is the resource for Organism to be pushing an object, with a certain Force (effort), during every moment of a certain time period.

Now more on Work.

Any Work is the process of pushing, meaning is Mechanical Work.

Any Work (Mechanical Work) is a push or combination of pushes.

Even though some of Works might probably not seem to someone that these are  pushes (Mechanical Work), in reality, any Work is a push or combination of pushes, meaning is Mechanical Work. I will give you just one example below.

The heating-up is also a combination of pushes, because any process of heating up an object is due to the increase in the velocities of particles inside the object. And the increase in the velocities of the particles occurs only because these particles are being pushed by some things ("Hands"). Therefore, any heating-up is a combination of pushes. And this means that the heating-up is Work and that Energy (some resource) is always being spent on this Work.

Importantly, there are Target Works and Non-Target Works.

## 2.4. Target Works and Non-Target Works

Target Work is the Work that is the target for Organism to be doing while working.

Non-Target Work is any Work that isn't the target for Organism but is unavoidable for Organism to be doing while doing Target Work-- meaning is additional but unavoidable.

For example, for an Electric Motor (as an example of Organism):

* Target Work for Organism is to be pushing the shaft.

* Non-Target Work for Organism is to be heating up while doing Target Work

For example, in Case #1:

* Target Work for Organism is to be pushing the 20 kg object upwards.

* Non-Target Work for Organism is to be heating up while doing Target Work

As we can see,

Non-Target Work is the "inside" Work of Organism that Organism must unavoidably be doing inside itself in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

The Universe as whole or each Organism separately works this way: each Target Work causes at least one Non-Target Work.

In other words,

Non-Target Work is unavoidable for Organism and the amount of Energy which is being spent on Non-Target Work is just the "additional energy-price" that Organism is unavoidably "paying" in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

Of course, not all of Energies are spent on (are converted to) Target Works. Those Energies that are spent on Non-Target Works, we consider our losses.

## 2.5. New Concept of Force

Of course,

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism, by your hand, is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

Of course, it all is so.

Plus simultaneously,

Each Force is striving to increase Velocity of the pushed object.

In other words,

Force is the process where Organism, by its Hand, is pushing an object in a certain direction, striving (by the pushing) to increase Velocity of the pushed object.

Note: strive means to make an effort to accomplish a target.

The New Concept of Force is:

> ### Force is the process where Organism, by its Hand, is pushing an object in a certain direction, striving (by the pushing) to increase Velocity of the pushed object at the rate equal to Target Acceleration.**.

At the rate equal to Target Acceleration!

--

## 2.6. Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force

In my opinion, each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) -- while pushing an object -- is to give the object the downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). 

Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” associated with Gravitational Force.

Target Acceleration -- which is the target for Gravitational Force -- is always 9.8 (m/s²).

Moreover, in reality, each Force, while pushing an object, has its target, meaning has such a characteristic as Target Acceleration.

In other words, 

Target Acceleration is THE feature/attribute/characteristic of each Force.

> ### Target Acceleration is the acceleration that Force (Organism), while pushing an object, is striving to give to the pushed object.

In other words,

> ### Target Acceleration is the acceleration that Organism, by its Hand, while pushing an object, is striving to give to the pushed object.

## 2.7. New Formula for Force

The New Formula for Force is:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — the Force pushing an object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — the mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
Target — the Target Acceleration: the acceleration that the given Force, while pushing an object, is striving to give to the pushed object (measured in meter/second²: m/s²)

## 2.8. New Law of Conservation of Energy

Importantly, all official formulas for calculating Work and Energy are absolutely wrong.

The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact. 

This fact was proven here: [link](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a).

Before I postulate the New Law of Conservation of Energy, it is needed to say that I had been loving the "old" law of Conservation of Energy for a long time.

The "old" law is so beautiful and easily-understandable: 

*Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.*

Even some cases proved this law.

The law looked symmetrical, harmonious, ideal and true. 

I was loving it a lot.

But, my findings prove that this law is just the "wishful thinking".

And the "wishful thinking" isn’t useful in science.

Truth is not what we should love a lot but what is in reality.

Official science wrongly considers that Energy is only the thing that can always be converted to another form Energy, but in reality Energy is just the resource that is being spent on Work. In some cases, the result of Work cannot be converted back to Energy.

Below we will see this.

Now, whether you like it or not, but the New Law of Conservation of Energy -- which is a true Law of Conservation of Energy -- is following:

> **In some cases, Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another, but in another cases, Energy can be taken for free or can be destroyed**

Below we will see confirmation of this New Law of Conservation of Energy.
