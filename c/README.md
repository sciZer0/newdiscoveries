## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might [see](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a), all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ### The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

But there is another fundamental errors:

* the official concept of Work, being wrong
* the official concept of Energy, being wrong
* the official Law of conservation of Energy, being wrong
* the official concept of Force, being wrong

All these fundamental errors together result in the endless series of errors in science.

## 2.1. Work and Energy in the Most General Sense

In modern science the whole logic about Energy is absolutely wrong, so we need to start from the very beginning, from defining Work and Energy in the Most General Sense.

So.

Even official science consider that The Universe in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

I absolutely agree with this above.

Let’s call anything (anyone) that can do Work “System”.

In my opinion, in the most general sense,

> ### Work is any activity of System that is spending Energy (some resource).

In other words,

Work is any activity of System that requires Energy (some resource).

On the other hand, 

> ### Energy is the resource for System to do Work.

And of course, 

> ### Work and Energy have the same unit of measure.

--

## 2.2. New Concept of Work and New Concept of Energy

Importantly, when System using its resources is pushing an object in a certain direction during some time, even if the object is staying motionless while the pushing, it cannot be for free --  some resource is being spent on the pushing.

Each pusshing done by System requires Energy (some resource).

Each pusshing done by System is spending Energy (some resource).

In my opinion,

> **Work is the process when a System using its resources is pushing an object with a certain effort during some time.**


Simply put, Work is the pushing done by System.

Some of Works, at first glance, probably might not seem like they are the pushes. But this might only be just at first glance. In reality, any Work Work is a push or a combination of pushes. I will give you just one example.

The heating-up is also a result of pushes, because any process of heating up an object is due to the increase in the velocities of particles inside the object. And the increase in the velocities of the particles occurs only because these particles are being pushed by some things. Therefore, any heating-up is the result of a lot of pushes. And this means that the heating-up is Work and that Energy (some resource) is always being spent on this Work.

On the other hand,

> **Energy is the resource for System to do Work**


Importantly, there are Target Works and Non-Target Works.

Target Work is a work that is the target for System to be doing while working.

Non-Target Work is Work that isn't the target for System but is unavoidable for System to be doing while doing Target Work-- meaning is additional but unavoidable.

Target Work of System is the outside Work of System in relation of some object.

Non-Target Work is the inside Work of System that System must unavoidably be doing inside itself while doing Target Work.

For example, for an Electric Motor (as an example of System):

* Target Work is to be pushing the shaft.

* Non-Target Work is to be heating up while doing Target Work

In other words,

Non-Target Work is the inside Work of System that System must unavoidably be doing inside itself in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

Summarizing,

Non-Target Work is unavoidable for System and the amount of Energy which is being spent on Non-Target Work is just the "additional energy-price" that System is unavoidably "paying" in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

Of course, not all of Energies are spent on (are converted into) the Target Works. Those Energies that are spent on Non-Target Works, we consider our losses.

## 2.3. New Law of Conservation of Energy

Importantly, Energy is not the thing official science says it is. *More on this a bit below.*

Before I postulate the New Law of Conservation of Energy, it is needed to say that I had been loving the “old” Law of Conservation of Energy for a long time.

I was really so loving it.

The “old” Law is so beautiful and easily-understandable: 

*Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.*

It seemed ideal and true, I was loving it a lot.

But, this all is just “wishful thinking”.

And “wishful thinking” isn’t useful in science.

Truth is not what we should love a lot but what is in reality.

Official science mistakenly considers that Energy is only the thing that can always be converted to another form Energy, but in reality Energy is just the resource that is being spent on Work. In some cases, the result of Work cannot be converted back to Energy.

Now, whether you like it or not, but the New Law of Conservation of Energy -- which is a true Law of Conservation of Energy -- is following:

> **In some cases, Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another, but in another cases, Energy can be taken for free or can be destroyed**

## 2.4. New Concept of Force

The New Concept of Force includes the following:

* New Definition of Force

* Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force -- a new concept

* New Formula for Force

* New Understanding of the magnitude of Force

--

## 2.2. New Definition of Force

Of course,

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

Of course, it all is so.

But simultaneously,

Force is the process when a System using its resources is pushing an object, striving (by the pushing) to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object during every moment of pushing. Of course, the increase is possible if there isn't the same in magnitude Force being counter.

Note: strive means to make an effort to accomplish a target

Importantly, when a System using its resources is pushing an object in a certain direction, even if the object is staying motionless while the pushing, it cannot be for free --  some resource is being spent.

The New Definition of Force is:

> **Force is the process when a System using its resources is pushing an object, spending, for every moment, the absolutely enough resource/energy to increase Velocity of the pushed object at the rate equal to Target Acceleration.**

--

## 2.3. Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force

Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force is an important concept.

In my opinion, each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) -- while pushing an object -- is to give the object the downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). 

Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” associated with Gravitational Force.

Target Acceleration associated with Gravitational Force is always 9.8 (m/s²).

Moreover, in reality, each Force, while pushing an object, has its target, meaning has such a characteristic as Target Acceleration.

In other words, Target Acceleration is THE feature/attribute/characteristic of each Force.

> ### Target Acceleration is the acceleration that Force (System), while pushing an object, is striving to give to the pushed object.

The concept of Target Acceleration works like the Butterfly Effect, this new concept changes everything in science.


## 2.2. New Formula for Force

The New Formula for Force is:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — the Force pushing an object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — the mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
Target — the Target Acceleration associated with the given Force (measured in meter/second²: m/s²)

Please pay attention that

the “Target” (in the formula) is namely Target Acceleration associated with the given Force, but not Real Acceleration of the pushed object,

and also that

each Force has its target, meaning that each Force has such a feature/attribute/characteristic as Target Acceleration.
