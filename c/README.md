## 1.2. Endless Series of Fundamental Errors in Science

As you might see, all the "official" formulas for calculating Work and Energy are absolutely wrong.

But there is THE Initial Fundamental Mistake that derives other fundamental errors.

The Initial Fundamental Mistake is that in science, there the Concept of Target Acceleration For Each Force is wrongly missing. <i>More detail on this in 2.1.</i>

The Initial Fundamental Mistake derives the wrong concept of Force, including the wrong formula of Force.

And, in its turn, the wrong concept of Force already derives other fundamental errors (including the wrong concept of Work and the wrong concept of Energy), resulting in the endless series of fundamental errors in science.
