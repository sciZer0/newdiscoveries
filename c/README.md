## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might [see](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a), all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ### The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

But there is THE Initial Fundamental Error that derives all other fundamental errors.

The Initial Fundamental Error is the official concept of Force (including the official formula of Force) being wrong. <i>More on this below.</i>

In its turn, the official concept of Force, being wrong, derives all other fundamental errors (including the official concept of Work and the official concept of Energy -- also being wrong) which all together results in the endless series of errors in science.

## 2.1. Work and Energy in the Most General Sense

In modern science the whole logic about Energy is absolutely wrong, so we need to start from the very beginning, from defining Work and Energy in the Most General Sense.

So.

Even official science consider that The Universe in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

I absolutely agree with this.

Let’s call anything (anyone) that can do Work “System”.

In my opinion, in the most general sense,

> ### Work is any activity of System that spends Energy.

In other words, 

Work is any activity of System that requires Energy (resource).

On the other hand, 

> ### Energy is the resource for System to do Work.

Importantly, there are Target Works and Non-Target Works.

Target Work is a work that is the target for System to do.

Non-Target Work is Work that isn't the target but is unavoidable for System to do while doing Target Work-- meaning is additional but unavoidable.

Of course, not all of Energies are spent on (are converted into) the Target Works. Those Energies that are spent on Non-Target Works, we consider our losses. *More on it a bit below.*

## 2.2. New Concept of Force

As said above, the Initial Fundamental Error deriving all other fundamental errors is the official concept of Force (including the official formula of Force) being wrong.

In its turn, the official concept of Force, being wrong, derives all other fundamental errors (including the official concept of Work and the official concept of Energy -- also being wrong) which all together results in the endless series of errors in science.

The New Concept of Force includes the following:

* New Definition of Force

* Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force -- a new concept

* New Formula for Force

* New Understanding of the magnitude of Force

## 2.2. New Definition of Force

Of course,

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

Of course, it all is so.

But simultaneously,

Force is the process when a System, using its resources is pushing an object, striving (by the pushing) to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object during every moment of pushing.</b>

Let’s take, for example, Gravitational Force.

All that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can be doing during any moment is to be pushing (or also we might say “pulling/attracting" ) an object downwards (closer to Earth), striving (by the pushing) to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object during every moment of pushing.

Importantly, in some cases, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can be increasing Velocity of the pushed object (for example, in the case when the pushed object is free-falling”),

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
</p>

but, in some other cases, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) cannot be increasing Velocity of the pushed object (for example, in the case when the pushed object is sitting on a table --  and in this case, the result of the pushing is that the pushed object is being pressed to the table surface).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/sitting.png"/><br>
</p>

As we can see, in some cases, the increase of Velocity of the pushed object is possible for Gravitational Force, but in some other cases, it is impossible for Gravitational Force.

Importantly, in both (or we might say "in each") of these 2 cases above, during every moment, 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/196.png"/><br>
</p>

Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is doing the same thing -- it is pushing the 20 kg object downwards with the same Force (effort), striving (by the pushing) to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object during every moment of pushing.

Note: strive means to make an effort to accomplish a target

The New Definition of Force is:

> ### Force is the process when a System is pushing an object, spending, for every moment, the absolutely enough resource/energy/effort to increase Velocity of the pushed object at the rate equal to Target Acceleration.

## 2.3. Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force

Target Acceleration is an important concept.

In my opinion, each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) -- while pushing an object -- is to give the object the downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). 

Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” associated with Gravitational Force.

Target Acceleration associated with Gravitational Force is always 9.8 (m/s²).

Moreover, in reality, each Force, while pushing an object, has its target, meaning has such a characteristic as Target Acceleration.

In other words, Target Acceleration is THE feature/attribute/characteristic of each Force.

> ### Target Acceleration is the acceleration that Force (System), while pushing an object, is striving to give to the pushed object.

The concept of Target Acceleration works like the Butterfly Effect, this new concept changes everything in science.


## 2.2. New Formula for Force

The New Formula for Force is:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — the Force pushing an object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — the mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
Target — the Target Acceleration associated with the given Force (measured in meter/second²: m/s²)

Please pay attention that

the “Target” (in the formula) is namely Target Acceleration associated with the given Force, but not Real Acceleration of the pushed object,

and also that

each Force has its target, meaning that each Force has such a feature/attribute/characteristic as Target Acceleration.

## 2.14. New Law of Conservation of Energy

Before I postulate the New Law of Conservation of Energy, it is needed to be said that I had been loving the “old/current-official” Law of Conservation of Energy for a long time.

I was so loving it.

The “old” Law is so beautiful and so easily-understandable: 

Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.

It seemed so ideal and true, I was loving it a lot.

Although, this all is just “wishful thinking”.

But “wishful thinking” isn’t useful in science.

Truth is not what we should love a lot but what is in reality, what we can watch in reality.

Now, whether you like it or not, but the New Law of Conservation of Energy -- which is a true Law of Conservation of Energy -- is following:

In some cases, Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another, but in some other cases, Energy can be destroyed or created for free.


The New Law of Conservation of Energy consists of 2 parts.

Also, before postulating The New Law of Conservation of Energy it is needed to say about Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems.

Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems
Energy-Isolated System is a system which is energy-closed in relation to all other systems — is energy-closed in relation to the rest the universe.

Energy-Non-Isolated System is a system which is energy-non-closed in relation to some other systems — is energy-non-closed in relation to the rest the universe. Another term for it might be the energy-semi-closed system.

Very often, people think about some specific systems as Energy-Isolated but they indeed are Energy-Non-Isolated.

For example, let’s take a simple solid iron table.
