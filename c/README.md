## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might see, all the "official" formulas for calculating Work and Energy, importantly -- being fundamental, are absolutely wrong.

But there is THE Initial Fundamental Error that derives all other fundamental errors.

The Initial Fundamental Error is the wrong concept of Force, including the wrong formula of Force.

The wrong concept of Force, in its turn, derives other fundamental errors (including the wrong concept of Work and the wrong concept of Energy), resulting in the endless series of errors in science.
