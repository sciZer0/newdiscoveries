## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might [see](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a), all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ### The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

But there is another fundamental errors:

* the official concept of Work, being wrong
* the official concept of Energy, being wrong
* the official Law of conservation of Energy, being wrong
* the official concept of Force, being wrong

All these fundamental errors together result in the endless series of errors in science.

## 2.1. Work and Energy in the Most General Sense

In modern science the whole logic about Energy is absolutely wrong, so we need to start from the very beginning, from defining Work and Energy in the Most General Sense.

So.

Even official science considers that The Universe in general is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this Big Organism can do some work and always, just like your organism, this Big Organism must spend some resource (energy) of the organism on this work.

Importantly, I absolutely agree with this above.

Let’s call anyone (anything) that can do Work “Organism”.

Of course, we might use the "System" word instead of the "Organism" word but the reason of the choice will be clear a bit below.

So, 

> ### Organism is anyone (anything) that can be doing Work


In my opinion, in the most general sense,

> ### Work is any activity of Organism that is spending Energy (some resource).

Or in other words,

* Work is any activity of Organism that requires Energy (some resource)
* Work is any activity of Organism that is reducing Energy (some resource)

On the other hand, 

> ### Energy is the resource for Organism to be doing Work.

And of course, 

> ### Work and Energy have the same unit of measure.

## 2.2. Concept of Organism and its Hand

Let's consider the 4 cases simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

In Case #1, a human is very very slowly lifting the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, a human is holding the 20 kg object motionless in the air during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, the 20 kg object is free-falling during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #4, the 20 kg object is sitting motionless on the table during 30 seconds.<br>

What is happening in reality is the following:

In Case #1, a human is pushing upwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #2, a human is pushing upwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #3, the Universe is pushing downwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>
In Case #4, the Universe is pushing downwards the 20 kg object during 30 seconds.<br>

In Case #1 and Case #2, Organism is a human (say, you).

In Case #3 and Case #4, Organism is the Universe/Nature.

Importantly, in each of the 4 cases,

> ### Organism is pushing the 20 kg object.

More importantly, in each of the 4 cases, 

> ### Organism is pushing the 20 kg object by its "Hand".

In Case #1 and Case #2, Hand is the human's hand (say, your hand).

In Case #3 and Case #4, Hand is Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand). 

*More on Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is [here](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a).*

Exremely importantly, in each of the 4 cases, 

> ### During every moment of 30 seconds, Organism by its Hand is pushing the 20 kg object with the same effort (Force) equal 196 Newtons.

*More on how to calculate the effort (Force) with which Organism is pushing the 20 kg object a bit below.*

## 2.4. New Concept of Work and New Concept of Energy

In my opinion, any Work is the pushing done during some time with some effort (Force).

In other words, any Work is a push or combination of pushes.

At first glance, some of Works might probably not seem to someone that these are the pushings. But in reality, any Work is a push or combination of pushes. I will give you just one example below.

The heating-up is also a result of pushes, because any process of heating up an object is due to the increase in the velocities of particles inside the object. And the increase in the velocities of the particles occurs only because these particles are being pushed by some things. Therefore, any heating-up is the result of a lot of pushes. And this means that the heating-up is Work and that Energy (some resource) is always being spent on this Work.

In my opinion,

when Organism using its resources is pushing an object in a certain direction during some time by its Hand with some effort, even if the object is being motionless while the pushing, it cannot be for free --  some resource is being spent on the pushing.

Let's consider again the 4 cases simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/cases.png"/><br>
</p>

Importantly, in each of the 4 cases, 

Organism using its resources is pushing an object in a certain direction during 30 seconds by its Hand with same effort (Force) equal to 196 Newtons, and even when the object is being motionless while the pushing (Case #2 and Case #4), it cannot be for free --  some resource is being spent on the pushing.

The New Concept of Work is:

> ### Work is the process when a Organism using its resources is pushing an object during some time by its Hand with a certain effort (Force).

In other words,

Work is the pushing done by Organism.

The truth is each of the following:

* Each pusshing done by Organism requires Energy (some resource);

* Each pusshing done by Organism is spending Energy (some resource);


On the other hand, as we already know:

Energy is the resource for Organism to be doing Work.

The New Concept of Energy is:

> ### Energy is the resource for Organism to be pushing an object during some time by its Hand with some effort (Force).

## 2.5. Target Works and Non-Target Works

Importantly, there are Target Works and Non-Target Works.

Target Work is Work that is the target for Organism to be doing while working.

Non-Target Work is Work that isn't the target for Organism but is unavoidable for Organism to be doing while doing Target Work-- meaning is additional but unavoidable.

Target Work of Organism is the outside Work of Organism in relation of some object.

Non-Target Work is the inside Work of Organism that Organism must unavoidably be doing inside itself while doing Target Work.

For example, for an Electric Motor (as an example of Organism):

* Target Work is to be pushing the shaft.

* Non-Target Work is to be heating up while doing Target Work

In other words,

Non-Target Work is the inside Work of Organism that Organism must unavoidably be doing inside itself in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

Summarizing,

Non-Target Work is unavoidable for Organism and the amount of Energy which is being spent on Non-Target Work is just the "additional energy-price" that Organism is unavoidably "paying" in order to have the possibility of doing its Target Work.

Of course, not all of Energies are spent on (are converted to) the Target Works. Those Energies that are spent on Non-Target Works, we consider our losses.

## 2.6. New Law of Conservation of Energy

Importantly, Energy is not the thing official science says it is. *More on this a bit below.*

Before I postulate the New Law of Conservation of Energy, it is needed to say that I had been loving the “old” Law of Conservation of Energy for a long time.

I was really so loving it.

The “old” Law is so beautiful and easily-understandable: 

*Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.*

It seemed ideal and true, I was loving it a lot.

But, this all is just “wishful thinking”.

And “wishful thinking” isn’t useful in science.

Truth is not what we should love a lot but what is in reality.

Official science mistakenly considers that Energy is only the thing that can always be converted to another form Energy, but in reality Energy is just the resource that is being spent on Work. In some cases, the result of Work cannot be converted back to Energy.

Now, whether you like it or not, but the New Law of Conservation of Energy -- which is a true Law of Conservation of Energy -- is following:

> **In some cases, Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another, but in another cases, Energy can be taken for free or can be destroyed**

And below we will see confirmation of this New Law of Conservation of Energy.

## 2.7. New Concept of Force

Of course,

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

Of course, it all is so.

But simultaneously,

Force is the process when a Organism using its resources is pushing an object, striving (by the pushing) to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object during every moment of pushing. Of course, the increase is possible if there isn't the same in magnitude Force being counter.

Note: strive means to make an effort to accomplish a target

Importantly, when a Organism using its resources is pushing an object in a certain direction, even if the object is staying motionless while the pushing, it cannot be for free --  some resource is being spent.

The New Concept of Force is:

> **Force is the process when a Organism using its resources is pushing an object, spending, for every moment, the absolutely enough resource/energy to increase Velocity of the pushed object at the rate equal to Target Acceleration.**

--

## 2.8. Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force

Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force is an important concept.

In my opinion, each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) -- while pushing an object -- is to give the object the downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). 

Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” associated with Gravitational Force.

Target Acceleration associated with Gravitational Force is always 9.8 (m/s²).

Moreover, in reality, each Force, while pushing an object, has its target, meaning has such a characteristic as Target Acceleration.

In other words, Target Acceleration is THE feature/attribute/characteristic of each Force.

> ### Target Acceleration is the acceleration that Force (Organism), while pushing an object, is striving to give to the pushed object.

The concept of Target Acceleration works like the Butterfly Effect, this new concept changes everything in science.


## 2.9. New Formula for Force

The New Formula for Force is:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — the Force pushing an object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — the mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
Target — the Target Acceleration associated with the given Force (measured in meter/second²: m/s²)

Please pay attention that

the “Target” (in the formula) is namely Target Acceleration associated with the given Force, but not Real Acceleration of the pushed object,

and also that

each Force has its target, meaning that each Force has such a feature/attribute/characteristic as Target Acceleration.
