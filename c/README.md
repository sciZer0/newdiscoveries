## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might see, all the "official" formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong.

But there is THE Initial Fundamental Error that derives all other fundamental errors.

The Initial Fundamental Error is the wrong concept of Force, including the wrong formula of Force.

The wrong concept of Force, in its turn, derives all other fundamental errors (including but not limited to the wrong concept of Work and the wrong concept of Energy) which all together are resulting in the endless series of errors in science.

## 2.1. New Concept of Force

In modern science the whole logic about Energy is absolutely wrong so we need to start from almost the very beginning, from Force.

The New Concept of Force includes the following:

* New Definition of Force

* Target Acceleration for each Force (It is a new concept)

* New Formula for Force

* New Understanding of the magnitude of Force


## 2.1. New Definition of Force

Of course,

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

Of course, it all is.

But simultaneously,

<b>Force is anything that is trying/striving to accelerate an object.</b>

In other words:

<b>Force is a process of pushing an object in a certain direction, and this pushing is trying/striving to accelerate the object.</b>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand is trying/striving to accelerate the pushed object, the wall.

In reality, what happens is that your hand is trying/striving to increase the velocity of the pushed object (the wall) in a certain direction (shown by the green arrow). Importantly, it is so even when the velocity of the pushed object (the wall) remains zero during the pushing.

The New Definition of Force:

><b>Force is anything that is trying/striving to accelerate an object up to Target Acceleration.</b>



## 2.1. Target Acceleration for each Force

Target Acceleration for each Force is the most important concept.

In my opinion, each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) while pushing an object is to give the object the Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” for Gravitational Force.

Or, we might call this downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) the “Target Acceleration” for “this” Force, or “Target Acceleration” for “this” Push.

Importantly, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand), pushing an object with some specific mass, always has its Target Acceleration. Target Acceleration of Gravitational Force is always 9.8 (m/s²).

Moreover, in reality, each Force, pushing an object with some specific mass, has its Target Acceleration.

In other words, Target Acceleration is THE feature (attribute) of each Force.

The concept of Target Acceleration For Each Force works like the “Butterfly Effect”, this new concept changes everything.

The concept fundamentally improves our understanding of the Universe, opening up the other two most important new concepts: New Concept of Force and New Concept of Mechanical Work: Static Mechanical Work.


## 2.2. New Formula for Force or True Newton’s Formula for Force

In my opinion, the True Newton’s Formula for calculating Force is:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,
F — Force pushing the object (Newton: N);
m — Mass of the pushed object (kilogram: kg);
Target — Target Acceleration for the given Force (meter/second²: m/s²)

Please pay attention that the “a” there is namely Target Acceleration for the given Force, but not Real Acceleration of the pushed object.

2.3. Work and Energy in the Most General Sense
The Universe at large is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this big organism can do Work and always, just like your organism, must spend Energy (resource) of the organism on this Work.

We can call each of both your organism and the Universe (Big Organism) “System” which can do Work.

Let’s call any organism or device which can do Work “System”.

In my opinion, in the most general sense,

Work is

· any activity of System that requires Energy (resource) of System, or
· any activity of System that spends Energy (resource) of System, or
· any activity of System that reduces Energy (resource) of System, or

Energy is the ability (resource) of System to do Work.

## 2.14. New Law of Conservation of Energy

Before, I postulate the New Law of Conservation of Energy, it is needed to be said that I had been loving the “old/current-official” Law of Conservation of Energy for a long time.

I was so loving it.

The “current” Law is so beautiful and so easily-understandable: 

Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.

It seemed so ideal and true, I was loving it a lot.

Although, this all is just “wishful thinking”.

But “wishful thinking” isn’t useful in science.

Truth is not what we should love a lot but what is in reality, what we can watch in reality.


Whether you like it or not, but the New Law of Conservation of Energy -- which is a true Law of Conservation of Energy -- is following:

In some cases, Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another, but in some other cases, Energy can be destroyed or created for free.


The New Law of Conservation of Energy consists of 2 parts.

Also, before postulating The New Law of Conservation of Energy it is needed to say about Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems.

Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems
Energy-Isolated System is a system which is energy-closed in relation to all other systems — is energy-closed in relation to the rest the universe.

Energy-Non-Isolated System is a system which is energy-non-closed in relation to some other systems — is energy-non-closed in relation to the rest the universe. Another term for it might be the energy-semi-closed system.

Very often, people think about some specific systems as Energy-Isolated but they indeed are Energy-Non-Isolated.

For example, let’s take a simple solid iron table.
