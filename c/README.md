## 1.2. Endless Series of Errors in Science

As you might [see](https://github.com/sciZer0/newdiscoveries/tree/main/a), all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy -- importantly, being fundamental -- are absolutely wrong. Now, the wrongness of all these official formulas is a proven fact.

> ## The wrongness of all the official formulas for calculating Work and Energy is a proven fact.

But there is THE Initial Fundamental Error that derives all other fundamental errors.

The Initial Fundamental Error is the official concept of Force (including the official formula of Force) being wrong. <i>More on this below.</i>

In its turn, this official concept of Force, being wrong, derives all other fundamental errors (including the official concept of Work and the official concept of Energy -- also being wrong) which all together results in the endless series of errors in science.

## 2.1. New Concept of Force

In modern science the whole logic about Energy is absolutely wrong, so we need to start from almost the very beginning, from Force.

The New Concept of Force includes the following:

* New Definition of Force

* Target Acceleration as the feature of each Force -- a new concept

* New Formula for Force

* New Understanding of the magnitude of Force

## 2.2. New Definition of Force

Of course,

<b>Force is a push.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/8.png"/><br>
</p>

In other words:

<b>Force is the process of pushing an object in a certain direction.</b>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/9.png"/><br>
  <i>The green arrow shows the<br>
  direction of the pushing</i>
</p>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand creates a push (process of pushing), and it means your hand creates Force.

Of course, it all is so.

But simultaneously,

<b>Force is anything that is striving (by the pushing) to accelerate an object.</b>

In other words:

<b>Force is a process of pushing an object in a certain direction, striving (by the pushing) to accelerate the object.</b>

For example, when your organism (in particular, your hand) is pushing a strong wall with some great effort,

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/10.png"/><br>
  <i>Your hand creates Force</i>
</p>

your hand is striving to increase the velocity of some pushed object in a certain direction (shown by the green arrow).

Let’s take, for example, Gravitational Force.

All that Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can be doing during any moment is to be pushing (or also we might say “pulling/attracting" ) an object downwards (closer to Earth), trying (by the pushing) to increase the velocity of the pushed object -- to accelerate the pushed object.

Importantly, in some cases, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) can be increasing the velocity of the pushed object (for example, in the case when the pushed object is free-falling”),

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/17.png"/><br>
</p>

but, in some other cases, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) cannot increase the velocity of the pushed object (for example, in the case when the pushed object is sitting on a table --  and in this case, the result of the pushing is that the pushed object is being pressed to the table surface).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/sitting.png"/><br>
</p>

As we can see, in some cases, the increase of the velocity of the pushed object is possible for Gravitational Force, but in some other cases, it is impossible for Gravitational Force.

Importantly, in  both (or we might say "in each") of these 2 cases above, during every moment, 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/blind.png"/><br>
</p>

Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is doing the same thing -- Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) is pushing the 20 kg object downwards, striving (by the pushing) to increase the velocity of the pushed object.

Note: strive means to make an effort to accomplish an target

The New Definition of Force is:

<b>Force is a push striving, during every moment, to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object at the rate equal to Target Acceleration.</b>


## 2.2. Target Acceleration

So, the New Definition of Force is:

<b>Force is a push striving, during every moment, to be increasing Velocity of the pushed object at the rate equal to Target Acceleration.</b>

Target Acceleration is the most important concept.

In my opinion, each Force has its target.

For example, the target for Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand) -- while pushing an object -- is to give the object the downward Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²). 

Therefore, we can call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” for Gravitational Force.

Or also, if wanted, we might call this Acceleration of 9.8 (m/s²) “Target Acceleration” for “this” Force, or “Target Acceleration” for “this” Push.

Importantly, Gravitational Force (Invisible Hand), while pushing an object, always has its Target Acceleration. Target Acceleration for Gravitational Force is always 9.8 (m/s²).

Moreover, in reality, each Force, while pushing an object, has such a characteristic as its Target Acceleration.

In other words, Target Acceleration is THE feature/attribute/characteristic of each Force.

The concept of Target Acceleration works like the “Butterfly Effect”, this new concept changes everything in science.

The concept fundamentally improves our understanding of the Universe, opening to us new doors -- other fundamental things, including: 

* New Formula for Force

* New Formula for Work

* New Formula for Energy

* New Sort of Mechanical Work: Static Mechanical Work


## 2.2. New Formula for Force

The New Formula for Force is:
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/Target.png"/><br>
</p>

where,<br>
F — the Force pushing an object (measured in Newtons: N);<br>
m — the mass of the pushed object (measured in kilograms: kg);<br>
Target — the Target Acceleration for the given Force (measured in meter/second²: m/s²)

Please pay attention that

the “Target” (in the formula) is namely Target Acceleration for the given Force, but not Real Acceleration of the pushed object

and also that

each Force has its target, meaning that each Force has such a feature/attribute/characteristic as Target Acceleration.

## 2.3. Work and Energy in the Most General Sense

The Universe at large is a big organism which is much similar to your organism; and just like your organism, this big organism can do Work and always, just like your organism, must spend Energy (resource) of the organism on this Work.

We can call each of both your organism and the Universe (Big Organism) “System” which can do Work.

Let’s call any organism or device which can do Work “System”.

In my opinion, in the most general sense,

Work is

· any activity of System that requires Energy (resource) of System, or
· any activity of System that spends Energy (resource) of System, or
· any activity of System that reduces Energy (resource) of System, or

Energy is the ability (resource) of System to do Work.

IMPORTANTLY

## 2.14. New Law of Conservation of Energy

Before I postulate the New Law of Conservation of Energy, it is needed to be said that I had been loving the “old/current-official” Law of Conservation of Energy for a long time.

I was so loving it.

The “old” Law is so beautiful and so easily-understandable: 

Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another.

It seemed so ideal and true, I was loving it a lot.

Although, this all is just “wishful thinking”.

But “wishful thinking” isn’t useful in science.

Truth is not what we should love a lot but what is in reality, what we can watch in reality.

Now, whether you like it or not, but the New Law of Conservation of Energy -- which is a true Law of Conservation of Energy -- is following:

In some cases, Energy can neither be created nor destroyed — only converted from one form of Energy to another, but in some other cases, Energy can be destroyed or created for free.


The New Law of Conservation of Energy consists of 2 parts.

Also, before postulating The New Law of Conservation of Energy it is needed to say about Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems.

Energy-Isolated Systems and Energy-Non-Isolated Systems
Energy-Isolated System is a system which is energy-closed in relation to all other systems — is energy-closed in relation to the rest the universe.

Energy-Non-Isolated System is a system which is energy-non-closed in relation to some other systems — is energy-non-closed in relation to the rest the universe. Another term for it might be the energy-semi-closed system.

Very often, people think about some specific systems as Energy-Isolated but they indeed are Energy-Non-Isolated.

For example, let’s take a simple solid iron table.
